# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the complete-library-management system. The system is designed to be scalable, modular, and maintainable, following best practices for software development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the backend code, including configuration, controllers, database, middlewares, routes, services, tests, and utilities.
- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend code, including public assets, source code, and configuration files.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the project, including API documentation, architecture documentation, system requirements, and database schema.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for various tasks such as database backup, restore, and environment setup.
- `deployments/`: Contains deployment configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, following a modular structure. The main components are:

- `config/`: Contains configuration files for environment variables, database, logger, and cache.
- `controllers/`: Contains controller logic for handling requests and responses.
- `database/`: Contains database connection logic, schema definitions, and migrations.
- `middlewares/`: Contains middleware functions for authentication, authorization, error handling, rate limiting, and request validation.
- `routes/`: Contains route definitions for various endpoints.
- `services/`: Contains business logic and service functions.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React and Vite, following a component-based structure. The main components are:

- `public/`: Contains public assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `src/`: Contains the source code, including components, pages, services, utilities, and hooks.
- `package.json`: Contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the frontend.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Contains the configuration for Tailwind CSS.
- `vite.config.js`: Contains the configuration for Vite.

## Deployment

The project supports deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. The main components are:

- `docker/`: Contains Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerizing the application.
- `kubernetes/`: Contains Kubernetes deployment, service, ingress, and secrets configurations.
- `ci-cd/`: Contains CI/CD pipeline configurations for GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

## Documentation

The documentation is organized into the following main sections:

- `api/`: Contains API documentation, including Swagger and Postman collections.
- `architecture.md`: Contains the architecture documentation (this document).
- `system-requirements.md`: Contains the system requirements documentation.
- `database-schema.md`: Contains the database schema documentation.

## Conclusion

This architecture documentation provides an overview of the complete-library-management system, including its project structure, backend and frontend architecture, deployment, and documentation. The system is designed to be scalable, modular, and maintainable, following best practices for software development.
